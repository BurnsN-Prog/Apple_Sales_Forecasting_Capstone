# Apple Inc. Quarterly Sales Forecasting (Capstone Project)

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast Apple Inc.'s quarterly net sales using a SARIMA model. The goal was to evaluate the model‚Äôs accuracy in both long-term and short-term forecasting.

## Key Files
- üìä **Notebook:** `Burns_D214_Task2.ipynb` ‚Äì Full data analysis and model building process in Python.
- üìù **Report:** `Burns_D214_Written Report.pdf` ‚Äì Formal capstone paper with detailed explanations.
- üì¢ **Presentation:** `Burns_D214_Presentation.pdf` ‚Äì Summary presentation slides.

## Results
- Long-term forecast: 67% accuracy (MAPE: 33%)
- Short-term forecast (5-year history, 1-year projection): 96% accuracy (MAPE: 3.97%)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, pmdarima)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways
- SARIMA is effective for short-term forecasting.
- Forecast accuracy decreases over long-term projections.
- Future work could integrate external factors like product launches, market trends, or consumer sentiment.

## How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) in any Jupyter environment (e.g., Anaconda, Google Colab).
